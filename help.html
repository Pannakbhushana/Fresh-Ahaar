        <h4 class="headings">What is KindMeal?</h4>
        <p class="para">

          meat-free lifestyle platform. We provide an effective platform to
          promote compassionate dining in a fun and effective way, that would

          cleaner environment and of course, save your hard-earned money.
        </p>
        <h4 class="headings">What is Meat-Free?</h4>
        <p class="para">
          Meat-free means that the food does not contain any meat, or
          ingredients derived from meat. However, it may contain some elements
          that people of certain diet do not consume, such as eggs, dairy /
          milk, or alcohol. Please refer to the details within each specific
          shop / deal for further information.
        </p>
        <h4 class="headings">How do I sign up to KindMeal? Is it free?</h4>
        <p class="para">
          Yes, it is absolutely free. To join our community of food lovers and
          grab awesome deals, please

        </p>
        <h4 class="headings">What is a Username?</h4>
        <p class="para">
          A Username is a nickname exclusively used to identify your profile. It
          will be used to access your Public Page, such as
          <a href="https://KindMeal.my/MyUsername"
            >https://KindMeal.my/MyUsername</a
          >, and it will also be displayed when you share KindMoments, comments
          and reviews.
        </p>
        <h4 class="headings">How do KindMeal deals work?</h4>
        <p class="para">
          Restaurants create attractive deals within KindMeal, which you can
          obtain coupons for. Our coupons differ from other conventional deal
          sites in that you <b>do not need</b> to make any upfront payment at
          KindMeal, and you can easily present our LiveCoupon via computer,
          mobile or laptop without any print coupons. For restaurants that do
          not require advance reservations, you can even use the LiveCoupon
          immediately! After all, eating is an impulsive decision, right?
        </p>
        <h4 class="headings">How do I get a KindMeal coupon?</h4>
        <p class="para">
          Just browse to a deal you like, select the corresponding outlet
          location (if the restaurant has multiple locations), then click on Get
          Coupon. Please note that the outlet location
          <b>cannot be changed</b> after the coupon is obtained. Each member is
          limited to 5 active coupons only. You must use the coupons before you
          can obtain additional ones. Unused coupons will automatically expire
          upon reaching its due date.
        </p>
        <h4 class="headings">What is KindWords?</h4>
        <p class="para">
          KindWords is a great way to tell your friends about the great food and
          instantly get more discount. For deals with KindWords enabled, you can
          enjoy DOUBLE the discount if you share the deal on Facebook or
          Twitter. Once you successfully share it, you will immediately receive
          the exclusive discount for your deal. If you prefer not to take
          advantage of KindWords, you can still proceed to get the deal at the
          normal discount price. Please note that not all deals support
          KindWords - it depends on the merchant.
        </p>
        <h4 class="headings">How do I use my KindMeal LiveCoupon?</h4>
        <p class="para">
          Once a coupon is received, you can access the LiveCoupon and use it
          via one of the following ways. An Internet connection is required. At
          KindMeal website, under Account ->
          <a href="https://www.kindmeal.my/member/index.php?action=coupons"
            >My Coupons</a
          >
          section With our KindMeal mobile app, under Deals -> My Coupons
          section You should only activate the LiveCoupon when you are at the
          restaurant, and upon informing the merchant. Some merchants may
          require that you activate it during the ordering process, while some
          will be during the payment process. Please inform the merchant first
          when you are ordering to ensure they are aware of your KindMeal
          LiveCoupon. Once an active LiveCoupon is loaded, you will see a timer
          counting down the time remaining to use it. To activate it, click on
          Use LiveCoupon. Please ensure that you only activate it upon the
          request of the merchant.
          <b>Activating it ahead of time may void your coupon and deal</b>.
        </p>
        <h4 class="headings">
          What if I don't have a mobile device or Internet connection, can I use
          a Print Coupon?
        </h4>
        <p class="para">
          This depends on the specific deal. If the merchant allows it, you can
          also choose to print out the coupon and bring it along. Please refer
          to the deal's Terms & Conditions to check if print coupons are
          allowed, and if any prior reservation and usage delay are required. To
          print your coupon, first access it via KindMeal website at the
          Account->Account ->
          <a href="https://www.kindmeal.my/member/index.php?action=coupons"
            >My Coupons</a
          >
          section, then click on Print Coupon at the corresponding coupon. If
          the Print Coupon button is not available, it means that only
          LiveCoupons are accepted for the deal.
        </p>
        <h4 class="headings">What is a Print Coupon's Usage Delay?</h4>
        <p class="para">
          Some merchants may not have the facilities available to verify Print
          Coupons instantly, so they may impose a Usage Delay of a certain
          number of days to first print out a cross-checking reference list. If
          there is a 3-Day delay, it means that you can only use the Print
          Coupon 3 days after obtaining the coupon. You may wish to check with
          the merchant first before using it. We strongly suggest using a
          LiveCoupon instead, which is immediate with no usage delays.

        <h4 class="headings">How do I create a shop and offer deals?</h4>
        <p class="para">
          You need to first sign up a
          <a href="https://www.kindmeal.my/joinshop.htm">merchant account</a>.

          Do I need to make any payments to get the deal coupons?
        </h4>
        <p class="para">
          No, absolutely no payment is required at KindMeal to obtain your
          coupon. You will only need to make payment at the restaurant when you
          use the coupon to purchase your food.
        </p>
        <h4 class="headings">What is a KindMoment?</h4>
        <p class="para">
          A KindMoment is a food selfie, a photo moment of your delicious food
          for sharing with the world, and to encourage meat-free dining. Sharing
          a KindMoment is extremely quick and easy, similar to other social
          photo sharing websites or mobile apps. If you link your KindMeal

          KindMoments there. On top of that, you can also manually share on
          Facebook and Twitter. The public can like and comment on your
          KindMoments, and you can also edit the KindMoment after publication.

        <p class="para">
          Restaurants can additionally showcase meat-free dishes and menu items.
          These items are different from deals, and there may not be offers
